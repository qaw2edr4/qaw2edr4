# Hi there 👋 I'm Willy

**Product Manager @ Work | Product Strategist @ Heart** *I’m currently bridging the gap between hardware and AI. I’m deep in the code right now—learning, building, and breaking things. I’m someone who will always have a stream of ideas, but I deeply value partners who aren't afraid to challenge them.*

### 🚀 The Mission: Agentic Forge
I am currently architecting the **Agentic Forge**, a system designed to ensure AI agents move with the same language and intent as the organization they serve.

### Project Ideas
- **The Problem:** AI reasoning is only as good as its data. If the "input" is low-quality, the "agent" is unreliable.
- **The Experiment:** I am testing how **high-fidelity sensory input** combined with **distributed edge intelligence** changes the outcome of AI tasks.
- **The Goal:** Proving that precision at the "input level" creates a massive downstream shift in AI accuracy.

### 🧪 What I'm Proving (Experimental Phase)
- **Agentic Distillation:** Using cloud reasoning to distill logic into lightweight, local agents.
- **Input Accuracy:** Comparing how precision signal vs. hobbyist hardware affects AI results.
- **Hardware Synergy:** Stress-testing industrial-grade boards against consumer hardware for 24/7 reliability.

### 👯 Let's Collab
If you are an excellent coder who wants a partner to handle the "Brain" work—product strategy and high-level architecture—let's talk. I'd love to see what we can build when we combine technical execution with strategic vision.
